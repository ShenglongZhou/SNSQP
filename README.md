# SNSQP

This Matlab package solves sparse quadratically constrained quadratic programming via semismooth Newton method

The solver was created based on the algorithm proposed by

Shuai Li, Shenglong Zhou, Ziyan Luo, Sparse Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programming via Semismooth Newton Method, [arXiv:2503.15109](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15109), 2025
